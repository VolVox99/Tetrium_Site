				2. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
			</h2>
			<p>
				Tetrium discloses potentially personally-identifying and
				personally-identifying information only to those of its
				employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i)
				need to know that information in order to process it on
				Tetrium's behalf or to provide services available at Tetrium's
				website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
				Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
				organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
				using Tetrium's website, you consent to the transfer of such
				information to them. Tetrium will not rent or sell potentially
				personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to
				anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
				organizations, as described above, Tetrium discloses potentially
				personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
				only in response to a subpoena, court order or other
				governmental request, or when Tetrium believes in good faith
				that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property
				or rights of Tetrium, third parties or the public at large.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are a registered user of https://tetrium.me and have
				supplied your email address, Tetrium may occasionally send you
				an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback,
				or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Tetrium
				and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this
				type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to
				a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support
				email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the
				right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to
				your request or to help us support other users. Tetrium takes
				all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the
				unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of
				potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
				information.
